I am a Physics Graduate Student and Doctoral Fellow at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. As a member of the **LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration**, my research is primarily focused on precessing binary searches.

### Research Interests
* **Waveform Modelling**: Refining models for complex binary systems.
* **Data Analysis**: Experience working with Gstlal pipelines, Bilby, and Pycbc.
* **Computational Physics**: Scientific machine learning, Normalizing flows and numerical analysis.
